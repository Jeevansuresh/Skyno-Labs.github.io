                      <h3 style="font-size:20px ;">Humanitarian Aid: This type of NGO provides aid to people who have been affected by natural disasters or conflict. They often provide food, shelter, medical care, and other essential services to those in need.<br><br>

						Environmental Protection: These NGOs work to safeguard the environment and protect it from harm. They may do things like advocate for conservation policies, promote sustainability initiatives, or conduct research on climate change.<br><br>
						
						Economic Development: This type of NGO helps developing countries grow their economies by working with local businesses and governments. They may offer training and support in areas like entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and trade skills.</h3><br><br>
                        <h1>The Importance of NGOs:</h1>
						<h2>Non-governmental organizations play a very important role in our society today. Here are just a few reasons why we need them:</h2>

						 <h3>To Serve Those In Need:</h3><h4>One of the main functions of NGOs is to help those who are less fortunate. They provide crucial services such as healthcare assistance, disaster relief, and economic development programs to people who would not otherwise have access to them.<br>
						
						 <h3>To Raise Awareness About Critical Issues:</h3><h4> Many NGOs use advocacy as one of their main tools for change. By raising awareness about pressing issues like human rights violations, environmental degradation, or poverty/hunger , they can inspire others to take action and make a difference.</h4><br>
						<h2>Conclusion :</h2> <h4>So we see that Non Governmental Organizations(NGOs) play a very significant role in our society by helping people who are less fortunate then us . We should all mobilize togetherand donate money goods or time to these great organisations so they can keep doing tremendous work</h4><br>
						<h3>NGOs! There are a lot of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the world that need help. People often think that they don’t have to do anything because they aren’t directly affected by the issue, but this isn’t true. Everyone can do something to help NGOs, and it doesn’t have to be a lot of work. In fact, there are many ways you can help without even leaving your home!</h3><br>
						<h3>That's where we come into play,Skyno Labs is an online course platform where we are organizing online courses possibly from the best Tutors and Raise half of the Course Price to the NGOs </h3><br>
						<h3>We are raising around 50% of the profit to NGOs and 40% to the course instructors(% may lower upon personal interest</h3><br>
